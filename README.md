## 🛡️ Rate Limiting

This API implements comprehensive rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. Different endpoints have specific rate limits based on their usage patterns:

### Rate Limit Configuration

| Endpoint Type | Rate Limit | Window | Description |
|---------------|------------|--------|-------------|
| **General** | 100 requests | 15 minutes | Applied globally to all endpoints |
| **Booking Operations** | 10 requests | 1 hour | For booking creation, updates, and management |
| **Facility Operations** | 20 requests | 15 minutes | For facility management and queries |
| **Health Check** | 30 requests | 1 minute | For health monitoring endpoints |
| **Database Operations** | 5 requests | 5 minutes | For database initialization and maintenance |

### Rate Limit Headers

When rate limits are exceeded, the API returns:
- **Status Code**: `429 Too Many Requests`
- **Headers**: `RateLimit-*` headers with limit information
- **Response**: JSON with error message and retry time

### Example Rate Limit Response

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.",
  "retryAfter": "15 minutes"
}
```
